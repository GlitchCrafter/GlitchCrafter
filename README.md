- 👋 Hi, I’m @GlitchCrafter
- 👀 I’m interested in learning various code bases, expansing my mind, decetralisation in nearly all aspects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my HTML, CSS, javascript skills and finding new ways to learn the code i need in order to accomplish the projects and goals that i have.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that focus on locally hosted, build in light code, small size and could be deployed locally, using alternative networks like Bluetooth, NFC,
- So that when the internet goes out, people can still have access to information, and locally share that information with their devices. Unikernals, modular self contained applications that can run cross platform, 
- Without the need of a traditional internet or server connection. Open source projects are my goal. Once i learn how to code! 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
